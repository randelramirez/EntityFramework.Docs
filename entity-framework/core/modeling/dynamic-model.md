# Alternating between multiple models with the same DbContext type

The model built in `OnModelCreating` could use a property on the context to change how the model is built. For example it could be used to exclude a certain property:

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/DynamicModel/DynamicContext.cs?name=Class)]

## IModelCacheKeyFactory

However if you tried doing the above without additional changes you would get the same model every time a new context is created for any value of `IgnoreIntProperty`. This is caused by the model caching mechanism EF uses to improve the performance by only invoking `OnModelCreating` once and caching the model.

By default EF assumes that for any given context type the model will be the same. To accomplish this the default implementation of `IModelCacheKeyFactory` returns a key that just contains the context type. To change this you need to replace the `IModelCacheKeyFactory` service. The new implementation needs to return an object that can be compared to other model keys using the `Equals` method that takes into account all the variables that affect the model:

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/DynamicModel/DynamicModelCacheKeyFactory.cs?name=Class)]
