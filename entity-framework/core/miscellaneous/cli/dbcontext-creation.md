# Design-time DbContext Creation

Some of the EF Core Tools commands (for example, the [Migrations][1] commands) require a derived `DbContext` instance
to be created at design time in order to gather details about the application's entity types and how they map to a
database schema. In most cases, it is desirable that the `DbContext` thereby created is configured in a similar
way to how it would be [configured at run time][2].

There are various ways the tools try to create the `DbContext`:

## From application services

If your startup project uses the [ASP.NET Core Web Host][3] or [.NET Core Generic Host][4], the tools try to obtain the
DbContext object from the application's service provider.

The tools first try to obtain the service provider by invoking `Program.CreateHostBuilder()`, calling `Build()`, then accessing the
`Services` property.

``` csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
        => CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();

    // EF Core uses this method at design time to access the DbContext
    public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args)
        => Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(
                webBuilder => webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>());
}

public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        => services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>();
}

public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
{
    public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options)
        : base(options)
    {
    }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> When you create a new ASP.NET Core application, this hook is included by default.

The `DbContext` itself and any dependencies in its constructor need to be registered as services in the application's
service provider. This can be easily achieved by having 
[a constructor on the `DbContext` that takes an instance of `DbContextOptions<TContext>` as an argument][5] and using the
[`AddDbContext<TContext>` method][6].

## Using a constructor with no parameters

If the DbContext can't be obtained from the application service provider, the tools look for the derived `DbContext`
type inside the project. Then they try to create an instance using a constructor with no parameters. This can be the
default constructor if the `DbContext` is configured using the [`OnConfiguring`][7] method.

## From a design-time factory

You can also tell the tools how to create your DbContext by implementing the `IDesignTimeDbContextFactory<TContext>`
interface: If a class implementing this interface is found in either the same project as the derived `DbContext` or in
the application's startup project, the tools bypass the other ways of creating the DbContext and use the
design-time factory instead.

``` csharp
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Infrastructure;

namespace MyProject
{
    public class BloggingContextFactory : IDesignTimeDbContextFactory<BloggingContext>
    {
        public BloggingContext CreateDbContext(string[] args)
        {
            var optionsBuilder = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<BloggingContext>();
            optionsBuilder.UseSqlite("Data Source=blog.db");

            return new BloggingContext(optionsBuilder.Options);
        }
    }
}
```

> The `args` parameter is currently unused. There is [an issue][8] tracking the ability to specify design-time arguments

A design-time factory can be especially useful if you need to configure the DbContext differently for design time than
at run time, if the `DbContext` constructor takes additional parameters are not registered in DI, if you are not using
DI at all, or if for some reason you prefer not to have a `BuildWebHost` method in your ASP.NET Core application's `Main` class.
