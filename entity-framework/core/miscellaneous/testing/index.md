# Testing components using EF Core

You may want to test components using something that approximates connecting to the real database, without the overhead of actual database I/O operations.

There are two main options for doing this:

* [SQLite in-memory mode](sqlite.md) allows you to write efficient tests against a provider that behaves like a relational database.
* [The InMemory provider](in-memory.md) is a lightweight provider that has minimal dependencies, but does not always behave like a relational database.
